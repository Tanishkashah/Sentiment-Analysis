# Sentiment Analysis Project

## Overview
This project aims to classify movie reviews as positive or negative using two different machine learning models: **Logistic Regression** and **Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) Classifier**. The models are built and evaluated using a publicly available dataset of movie reviews.

## Task Overview and Problem Statement
The goal of this project is to develop a sentiment analysis model that can accurately classify movie reviews as either positive or negative. This is achieved by leveraging two different modeling approaches: Logistic Regression and MLP Classifier.

## Dataset
The dataset used for this project is the IMDb dataset, which contains 50,000 movie reviews labeled as positive or negative. The dataset is publicly available and can be accessed publically

## Data Preprocessing
Data preprocessing steps include:
- Lowercasing the text
- Tokenization
- Removing punctuation and stopwords
- Stemming/Lemmatization
- Vectorization using TF-IDF

## Model Building
Two models were built for this project:
1. **Logistic Regression**: A simple and interpretable model for binary classification.
2. **MLP Classifier**: A neural network model capable of capturing complex patterns in the data.

## Model Training and Evaluation
Both models were trained on the preprocessed dataset and evaluated using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. The evaluation results are compared to determine the effectiveness of each model.

## Insights And Observations
- The MLP Classifier generally outperformed Logistic Regression in terms of accuracy and F1-score.
- Logistic Regression provided a strong baseline due to its simplicity and interpretability.

## Conclusion
This project demonstrated the effectiveness of both Logistic Regression and MLP Classifier for sentiment analysis. While the MLP Classifier showed better performance, Logistic Regression remains a valuable tool for simpler tasks.
